Today we started the Ethical Hacking classes and started to keep track of my progress. Checked and configured Cisco course and prepared. I had a voucher for a certification called KLCP (Kali Linux Certified Professional) from OffSec (Offensive Security) and wanted to pursue it. I thought it would be nice to take it now as it would be a good timing. I spend the afternoon going trough the course.
- 3h of Ethical Hacking class
